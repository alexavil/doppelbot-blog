		"content": "5 years ago, we created DoppelBot - a silly bot that sent pictures of Doppelganger Arle. Over the past years, we tried to make it a useful, free and open-source entertainment bot. We shifted from simple images to music, and while DoppelBot certainly has its ups and downs, I imagine some people are glad it exists.\nThe next update will feature a fresh look on DoppelBot, as well as restore the functionality that was missing for quite a while, thanks to the heated fight between Google and YouTube downloaders and third-party clients (including Invidious, which was used for InvidJS). This update will be released in 2 parts - the first part is aimed to restore the core functionality using local files, while the second part will feature the return of the online features.\nAlong with this update, we'll be opening up and sharing longer posts related to the development of DoppelBot and special notes to support those who wish to self-host this bot (which we actively encourage!). While this bot is still called DoppelBot internally, as part of this update you will be able to give it a bit of your own personality!\nThe update will be released on April 3, 2025, but for now...\nHappy Birthday DoppelBot!\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/\">Home</a>",

However, you can select multiple tracks to play from the cache.\nSharing is caring: Files will stay in the cache indefinitely and can be accessed by all guilds. There is currently no cache size limitation.\nInstance owners can wipe the cache at any time. Wiping the cache will disconnect all active players.\nNOTE: Online functionality is currently unavailable and will be restored in Part 2 of this update.\n\nPlay, pause, stop, seek and skip can now be used with a single /controls command.\n\nYou can no longer skip if there's only one track in the queue.
