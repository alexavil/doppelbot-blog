This Privacy Policy governs the collection, use, and sharing of personal information by DoppelBot and its instances. By deploying and using the bot, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

### **_Information We Collect_**

We use [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) to collect logs and reports necessary to provide support, bug fixes and stability improvements for the bot.

We collect the following information via Sentry:

- Your Geolocation: Country, City, Timezone and System Locale of a machine running DoppelBot or its instances
- Your Machine Specifications: OS, CPU, RAM, Boot Time
- Stack Traces and Logs

### **_How We Use Your Information_**

We use your information to operate and improve DoppelBot and its instances. We may also use your information to develop new features or services, provide bug fixes and stability improvements.

We do not use your information to train AI as we do not have any AI features. 

We do not have access and not share your or your bot's credentials. All credentials are stored locally on your machine and are only used to run DoppelBot and its instances.

### **_Sharing Your Information_**

We do not sell or share your personal information with third parties.

### **_Data Retention_**

We retain your information for as long as necessary depending on the information type.

We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction. However, no security measure is perfect, and we cannot guarantee the security of your information.

### **_Changes to this Policy_**

We may update this Privacy Policy, and we will post the updated policy on our website. Your use of updated versions of DoppelBot and its instances after we make changes to this policy indicates your acceptance of the revised policy. 

You will be sent a notification if any changes require your consent. You may continue to follow the older version of this Policy by using the older version of the bot.
