In the light of recent developments regarding *a popular AI bot service*, we would like to make a few statements regarding your privacy. 

- We do not use any data to train AI.
- We do not and will never include AI features for the forseeable future. 
- We do not have access to or share your credentials. They are only used locally to deploy the commands to Discord and to run the bot itself. 
- All special features of our bot (sending messages to channels, viewing stats and leaving guilds) are only available to users defined as "Owners" of the instance. Such information is stored locally. The developers have no way of accessing any custom instances.

You can verify our claims by checking the code, as DoppelBot is open-source. Our repo is located at https://github.com/alexavil/DoppelBot.

We've updated our [[Privacy Policy\|Privacy Policy]] reflecting these changes. You can view the Policy at any time by typing `/about` and selecting the respective button.
