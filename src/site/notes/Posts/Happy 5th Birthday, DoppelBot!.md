5 years ago, we created DoppelBot - a silly bot that sends pictures of Doppelganger Arle. Over the past years, we tried to make it a useful, free and open-source entertainment bot. We shifted from simple images to music, and while DoppelBot certainly has its ups and downs, I imagine some people are glad it exists. 

We're opening up this blog to share longer posts related to the development of DoppelBot and to support those who wish to self-host this bot (which we actively encourage!). While this bot is still called DoppelBot internally, you can now give it a bit of your own personality!

This year marked the heated fight between Google and YouTube downloaders and third-party clients (including Invidious, which was used for InvidJS). It halted the development for quite a while and caused a lot of changes. This update will be released in 2 parts - the first part is aimed to restore the core functionality, while the second part will feature the return of the online functionality. Read the full changelog for Part 1 of this update in the [[Update History\|Update History]]!

Happy Birthday DoppelBot!
