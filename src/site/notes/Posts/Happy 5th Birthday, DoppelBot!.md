5 years ago, we created DoppelBot - a silly bot that sent pictures of Doppelganger Arle. Over the past years, we tried to make it a useful, free and open-source entertainment bot. We shifted from simple images to music, and while DoppelBot certainly has its ups and downs, I imagine some people are glad it exists.

The next update will feature a fresh look on DoppelBot, as well as restore the functionality that was missing for quite a while, thanks to the heated fight between Google and YouTube downloaders and third-party clients (including Invidious, which was used for InvidJS). This update will be released in 2 parts - the first part is aimed to restore the core functionality using local files, while the second part will feature the return of the online features.

Along with this update, we'll be opening up and sharing longer posts related to the development of DoppelBot and special notes to support those who wish to self-host this bot (which we actively encourage!). While this bot is still called DoppelBot internally, as part of this update you will be able to give it a bit of your own personality!

The update will be released on April 3, 2025, but for now...

**_Happy Birthday DoppelBot!_**
